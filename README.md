# Jordi Lopez Portfolio 

Welcome to the first completed version of my personal portfolio website!

This site highlights who I am, what I’ve built, and where I’m headed as a Computer Science & Math student at UMass Lowell. It includes my projects, skills, background, and a contact section for internship opportunities, collaborations, or just connecting.

### Current Features:
- Fully responsive, clean UI built with modern tech
- Project cards with descriptions and GitHub links
- About section with academic background and story
- Skills & technologies overview
- Resume download and contact form
- Interactive particles and animations using Framer Motion
- **Visitor logging** via Supabase & Discord webhook integration (Deno backend, paused for now)

---

### Planned Updates:
- Live demos for featured projects
- Dark mode toggle
- More animations & UX polish
- Refined color palette and design tweaks
- Improved accessibility and performance
- Reactivation of backend visitor logging with Docker or Raspberry Pi hosting

This project is a living document of my growth, and I’ll continue updating it as I learn, build, and explore new tools.

Thanks for checking it out!
